# IUI_Final_Presentation
## Overall introduction
German Helper is a voice assistant that is supposed to teach you the German language in a “smart” way. The first idea that makes it “smart”, is that it is based on Voice User Interface, which is a human computer interaction mode centered on human intention and conversation. So you can learn German in a most natural way. The second would be emotional intelligence, which gives you relevant feedback that provides a long term learn incentive. The assistant will become your “personal” assistant, by gradually learning your preferences. 
## Motivation 
- Why VUI  
Dialog based interaction makes the learn process more natural in compare to GUI 
- Why is it used to learn   
  - Ubiquitous Learning  
  German helper provides learners with information and interaction anytime and anywhere. There are two advantages. Firstly, in the era of lifelong learning you do not need a motivation to open it. On the contrary, you will open google map only when you have a motivation of finding the route. Secondly, you can take good use of small fragment of time to perform short productive activities. The main scenarios for voice use in the US are home (43%), car (30%), and road (19%)
## What did we do
1. we have designed a basic concept of features
2. we have designed the dialog model 
3. Then we evaluated the technical feasibility in Alexa
4. after that we implemented the features 
5. then concepts for emotional intelligence were designed
6. see 4.
7. then concepts for context awareness were designed
8. see 4.
