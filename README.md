# IUI-Finalpresentation
## Overall introduction
German Helper is a voice assistant that is supposed to teach you the German language in a “smart” way. The first idea that makes it “smart”, is that it is based on Voice User Interface, which is a human computer interaction mode centered on human intention and conversation. So you can learn German in a most natural way. The second would be emotional intelligence, which gives you relevant feedback that provides a long term learn incentive. The assistant will become your “personal” assistant, by gradually learning your preferences. 
## Motivation
